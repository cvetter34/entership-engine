    p
      ' LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR
      ' EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE
      ' CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither Entership nor any
      ' of our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, suppliers, employees,
      ' shareholders, or directors ("Entership Affiliates") shall be
      ' cumulatively liable for (a) any damages in excess of five times the most
      ' recent monthly fee that you paid for a Premium Service, if any, or US
      ' $100, whichever amount is greater, or (b) any special, incidental,
      ' indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit,
      ' revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use of the
      ' Services, any Platform Applications or any of the content or other
      ' materials on, accessed through or downloaded from Entership. This
      ' limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between the
      ' parties and without it the terms and prices charged would be different.
      ' This limitation of liability shall:
    
    ul
      li
        ' Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort,
        ' statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known
        ' about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies
        ' provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and
      li
        ' Not apply to any damage that Entership may cause you intentionally or
        ' knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law, or as
        ' otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in this
        ' Agreement.
      li
        ' Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to purchase
        ' Premium Services with a separate Limitation of Liability provision
        ' that supersedes this section in relation to those Premium Services.

      ' this Agreement and your account for any reason or no reason, at any
      ' time, with or without notice. This cancellation shall be effective

      ' the Services commercially without Entership's authorization, infringing

      ' and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the
      ' intention of the provision; if a court or arbitrator finds the modified
